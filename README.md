# Mass-Spring-Damper-System
Write a MATLAB-Simulink program to simulate the  responses x(t) and v(t) of the system to given the initial conditions: x(0) = 0.04 m and  v(0) = 0 m/s. Plot the analytical responses obtained in part (b) vs. the computational  responses obtained in this part together to compare. Please remember to label the  axes, add legends, and title the plots.
